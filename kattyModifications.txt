I changed:
- Changed to the navbar home button location to "/" rather than "index.html", it looks better and more professional!
    (The location would be https://mr-flo-ax.vercel.app/ instead of https://mr-flo-ax.vercel.app/index.html)

I added:
- vercel.json
    - Cleans up the URLs, so instead of mr-flo-ax.vercel.app/socials.html, it'll just be mr-flo-ax.vercel.app/socials (example, applys to all pages)!
    - Info: https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#cleanurls

- Mobile Responsiveness
    - In the CSS file in "um si.css"

I removed: 
- Some CSS
    - I commented it in "um si.css" on line 1.
